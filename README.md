# Benchmark-cpp

This repository makes it easy to quickly whip out a C++ benchmark using [Google Benchmark](https://github.com/google/benchmark). In one command `make`, it downloads the Google library, builds with [CMake](https://cmake.org/) and generates a bmk binary from the bmk.cpp in the root folder.

To communicate your findings, copy and paste the content of bmk.cpp into [quick bench](https://quick-bench.com/).

## Usage

1. Clone this repository
2. `make`
3. `./.build/bmk`
4. (optional) copy and paste bmk.cpp into [quick bench](https://quick-bench.com/).
